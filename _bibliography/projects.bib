  abstract={As cities are growing, both in size and complexity, it has become increasingly important for transportation systems to integrate intelligent systems to improve their service quality. Transit systems are progressively using global positioning system (GPS) to extract real-time data of the transit units. These data can be used to extract multiple traffic stream characteristics. However, the primary step in using the GPS data is to process it and make it suitable for analyses. In this paper, we have discussed various issues which need to be resolved from the raw GPS data, which we obtained for a period of one month for 25 bus routes in Delhi. Subsequently, we have outlined a sequential approach to select the ideal method for processing the GPS data, so as to estimate travel time and speed on these routes. These measures can then be used further for assessing other traffic stream characteristics.},
