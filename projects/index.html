This rise of e-commerce has bridged the gap between the consumer and the retailer, thus improving economic viability in urban freight – first pillar of sustainability. Further, e-commerce has enabled demand consolidation and delivery route optimization, thereby enhancing environmental efficiency in urban freight – second pillar of sustainability. Moreover, e-commerce has facilitated access to vital products for otherwise disadvantaged communities, thus advancing social equity in urban freight – third pillar of sustainability. This sustainable growth potential of e-commerce has drawn a growing number of retailers to compete for market through increasingly consumer-focused services. Often such consumer-focused services necessitate frequent less-than-truckload last-mile deliveries. As a consequence, urban freight witnesses a substantial increase in distribution cost as well as transportation-related negative externalities including greenhouse gas emissions advancing climate change, and criteria pollutant emissions affecting health of communities located close to logistics clusters. Hence, consumer-focused services significantly worsen the economic viability, environmental efficiency, and social equity in urban freight. Thus, to leverage the opportunities and cope with the challenges associated with last-mile deliveries, e-retailers establish alternate last-mile distribution strategies. Unlike the conventional strategy that includes use of diesel vehicles for home deliveries, these alternate strategies could include use of electric delivery vehicles for last-mile operations, a fleet of crowdsourced delivery vehicles for last-mile delivery, consolidation facilities coupled with light-duty delivery vehicles for a multi-echelon distribution, collection-points for customer pickup, or even drones and robots for autonomous operations. Thus, the objective of this study is to assess sustainability of different last-mile distribution strategies across different Indian cities. To do so, this work will employ a Continuous Approximation (CA) based last-mile distribution model developed previously, and consequently, update and modify this model to account for the demographic, economic, and geographic characteristics of the cities. With this last-mile distribution model, this work will assess a) economic viability by evaluating the total cost of distribution stemming from fixed assets and associated operations; b) environmental efficiency by estimating the distribution-related emissions; and c) social equity by establishing the social cost of these emissions, for each of the different distribution strategies.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#2c5171"><a href="">PhD</a></abbr> </div> <div id="pahwa2025comprehensive" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">A comprehensive life cycle assessment of freight vehicles in India</div> <div class="author"> <em>Anmol Pahwa</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Jul 2025 - Jun 2026</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Coming soon...</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> <h2 class="bibliography">2024</h2> <ol class="bibliography"> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#714c2c"><a href="">MTech</a></abbr> </div> <div id="pahwa2024assessing" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Assessing sustainability of last-mile distribution strategies for e-commerce deliveries in Chennai</div> <div class="author"> <em>Anmol Pahwa</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Jun 2024 - May 2025</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The surge in internet access in the past decade has paved the way for retailers to expand their market horizon with e-commerce platforms.

As these travel patterns evolve, urban and transportation planning must adapt to meet these changes. Understanding and forecasting travel demand is crucial for effective infrastructure development and policy planning, ensuring that transportation systems align with the needs of the population. Thus, to identify typical travel demand patterns, this study will develop an activity-based model and simulate a day in the life of Indians. In particular, the authors will utilise the 2019 Indian Time Use Survey to model an individual’s daily activity plan as a Markov Process and consequently simulate transitions between daily activities such as work, education, leisure, domestic chores, etc., across different times of the day, while also accounting for individual, communal, and regional factors. In doing so, this study will inform stakeholders for better urban and transportation planning tailored to unique demographic and economic landscapes of different Indian cities.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm-2 abbr"> <abbr class="badge" style="background-color:#2c5171"><a href="">PhD</a></abbr> </div> <div id="pahwa2024exploring" class="col-sm-8"> <div class="title">Exploring determinants of consumer shopping behaviour in India</div> <div class="author"> <em>Anmol Pahwa</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Jul 2024 - Jun 2025</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abs</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>The retail sector, conventionally dominated by physical marketplaces with brick-and-mortar stores (organised) and itinerant merchants (unorganised), has witnessed an increasing presence of digital marketplaces in the past few years. The ease of shopping afforded by this surge in e-commerce has significantly reshaped individuals’ shopping behaviours and consequently, urban goods flow. What would previously be a trip to the bazaar is now a delivery to the home. This shift in urban goods flow from aggregate commercial to disaggregate residential locations raises concerns pertaining to sustainability of freight operations. Thus, the objective of this study is to understand the changing patterns of urban goods flow in Indian cities by exploring determinants of consumer shopping behaviour. In particular, using the 2019 Indian Time Use Survey, this work will develop a multinomial logit model to identify individual, communal, and regional factors that influence consumers’ choice of shopping channel. In doing so, this study empowers stakeholders with comprehensive consumer demand characteristics to develop targeted interventions that optimize freight operations and enhance sustainability of urban goods flow.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> </ol> </div> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom" role="contentinfo"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 LogNiti Lab. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@5.0.0/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-htrLFfZJ6v5udOG+3kNLINIKh2gvoKqwEhHYfTTMICc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.1.0/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-ZgMyDAIYDYGxbcpJcfUnYwNevG/xi9OHKaR/8GK+jWc=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?85ddb88934d28b74e78031fd54cf8308"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?5d75c11f89cd96294bf5e6dd1ee1bb30"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?fcfacfb8c6281f5e68d5a7d348186eb1"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?12775fdf7f95e901d7119054556e495f" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/jupyter_new_tab.js?d9f17b6adc2311cbabd747f4538bb15f"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/polyfill/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> </body> </html>
