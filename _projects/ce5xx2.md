# Objectives:

1.	Developing fundamental understanding of optimisation techniques and their application in solving optimization problems within transportation engineering.
2.	Modelling complex real-world transportation problems and solving them with both graphical and computer-based methods, with a particular focus on using Excel for practical implementations.
3.	Interpreting solutions derived from optimisation models and make informed decisions for improved solutions.

# Course Contents:

1.	Introduction to linear programming: Understanding the principles of linear programming, including the formulation of the objective function, decision variables, and constraints.
2.	Graphical solution technique: Developing competency in graphical solution techniques for linear programming to gain a visual understanding of the problem-solving process.
3.	Computer methods: Utilizing computer-based methods to solve linear programming problems with minimal programming.
4.	Problem solving: Modelling and solving key transportation problems using linear programming, such as the transportation assignment problem, trans-shipment problem, maximum flow problem, minimum spanning tree problem, least-cost path problem, vehicle routing problem, facility location problem, etc.
5.	Inferring results: Critically analysing the results from optimisation problems and assess their applicability and effectiveness in real-world transportation and logistics scenarios.
6.	Other formulations: A brief discussion on other problem formulations from Operations Research requiring non-linear programming, goal programming, dynamic programming, heuristics, queuing systems, Markov chains, etc.
