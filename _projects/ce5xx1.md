### Objectives:

1.	To understand the economic viability of transportation systems by identifying appropriate cost structures and consequently evaluating discounted fixed and daily variable costs.
2.	To explore environmental efficiency of transportation systems by evaluating transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions advancing global climate change, and criteria pollutant emissions affecting local community health.
3.	To assess social equity of transportation systems by examining the impact of transportation-related externalities on different communities. 
4.	To evaluate robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity of a transportation system against disruption.

### Outcomes:

1.	Critically examine freight and passenger transportation systems through the lens of sustainability and resilience to identify related gaps in them.
2.	Consequently, develop and propose strategies to enhance 
    Sustainability: Establish an economically viable, environment efficient, and socially equitable transportation system that is capable of handling high-probability low-severity fluctuations in the environment.
    Resilience: Establish a transportation system that is robust, redundant, resourceful, and rapid against low-probability high-severity disruptions in the environment.

### Course Contents:

1. Principles of Sustainability: Economic Viability – Fixed and Operational Cost; Environmental Efficiency – Greenhouse Gas  and Criteria Pollutant Emissions; Social Equity – Safety, Inclusivity, and Accessibility. 
2. Principles of Resilience: Robustness, Redundancy, Resourcefulness, and Rapidity. 
3. Case Studies: Specific freight and passenger transportation systems and the sustainability and resilience-  related gaps in them
4. Future of transportation: Three Revolutions in transportation – automation, electrification, and shared mobility in the context of sustainability and resilience of freight and passenger transportation.
