# Objectives:

1. Understanding the core principles of sustainability – economic viability, environmental efficiency, and social equity in the context of transportation engineering.
2. Investigating freight and passenger transportation systems through the framework of sustainability.
3. Augmenting sustainability with principles of resilience – robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, and rapidity.

# Course Contents:

1. Foundations: Introduction to principles of sustainability with an overview of sustainable transportation landscape – historic context and current opportunities and challenges.
2. Economic Viability: Understanding cost structures of different transportation systems to develop appropriate economic appraisals with discounted fixed costs and daily operational costs.
3. Environmental Efficiency: Exploring transportation-related emissions, including their types and associated norms. Understanding the impact of travel, weather, vehicle, roadway, traffic, and driver related factors on emission rates. Evaluating transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions advancing global climate change, and criteria pollutant emissions affecting local community health.
4. Social Equity: Assessing safety, inclusivity, and accessibility of transportation systems to meet the diverse needs of the population.
5. Case Study: Critically examining transportation systems through the lens of sustainability. Investigate specific freight and passenger transportation systems and identify economic, environment, and/or equity related gaps in them.
6. Lessons from the pandemic: Understanding the need for resilient transportation systems that are robust, redundant, resourceful, and rapid against disruptions.
7. Future of sustainable transportation: Examining 3 Revolutions in transportation – automation, electrification, and shared mobility in the context of freight and passenger transportation.
