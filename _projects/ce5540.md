### Objectives:

1.	To identify data needs for various transportation engineering applications.
2.	To apply mathematical concepts for analysing data from real-world applications.
3.	To employ programming tools for developing, implementing, and evaluating models in transportation engineering.
4.	To interpret model results for informed decision-making in transportation engineering.
5.	To develop technical reports with compelling data analysis, sophisticated models, and compelling visualizations.

### Course Content:

1.	Transportation Probabilistic Analysis: Probability Theory – fundamental concepts, properties of common distributions observed in transportation engineering; Statistical Inference – hypothesis testing, statistical errors; Software – write your own code in R.
2.	Transportation Data Analysis:– Foundations – data types, exploratory data analysis and data visualization; Regression – model estimation and diagnostics; Validation and Inference – model validation and interpretation of results; Case Studies – real-world applications in transportation engineering; Software – write your own code in R.
3.	Computer Methods and Applications: Foundations – principles of simulation models, macroscopic and microscopic simulation models for transportation engineering; Modelling – data requirements, model calibration and validation, mathematical formulations, and solution approaches for simulating transportation models; Software – write your own code in Python/Julia.
